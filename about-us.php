                            Having a humble beginning in 2012 at Berhampore, Murshidabad in West Bengal, this dream
                            venture of Mrs. Saha set its stage into the market with the likes of Kadam, Dolungi,
                            Roses and Chandramallika flowers, garlands, and Bengali wedding accessories such as
                            Topor-Mukut, all created out of shola wood craft.

                        <p class="">
                            It was later in the year 2013 that the District Industries Centre of West Bengal
                            honoured the organization to be a coveted partner and provider of the shola craft work.
                            This opportunity paved new horizons for the organization and helped it venture into
                            designing and merchandizing new sholacraft models including Paltola Nouka, Mayurpankhi
                            and howdah carriages.
